# Workshop 1

It was February 2, 2001, and Alan Green was finishing his first month as an analyst at the online banking group of Pilgrim Bank. The words of his boss, Ravi Raman, haunted his his head had barely left his office.


“Alan, we have a meeting at the end of next week with the management team to discuss about our internet strategy. There is substantial disagreement in our group on whether we have to start by charging for the use of the online banking channel or whether we should start by offering customers incentives such as discounts and lower service prices to motivate greater use of the channel. The debate really falls on whether online customers are actually better customers, and if the adoption of the online channel actually produces customers top. Since the closing data for the year 2000 will not be available until the next week, why don't you spend the weekend reviewing the relevant data from the close of the year 1999? Let's meet Monday morning to discuss your findings.”

Green knew that before he be able to analyze the data, he needed to understand more about the economics of retail banks. He decided to head to Jane Raines' office. Raines was a seasoned analyst in the group and he was sure she would be of help.

Raines responded, Balances are only part of the story. If you are interested in knowing how profitable customers are, then look directly at the earnings. You do not need to use the balances as a reference to the
profit as these are a subset of our customer profitability measure, which we have been evaluating for the past two years. 

- Roughly, we calculate the Pilgrim customer profitability with a fairly straightforward formula:
  - (Balance in Deposit Accounts) * (Net Margin between Interest Rates) + (Fees) + (Interest on Loans) - (Cost to serve)

Raines continued,
As you will notice, the balance level only captures a part of the customer's overall value for the bank. If you only focus on balances you are losing important components and income such as fees and ignoring the cost of serving individual clients.
